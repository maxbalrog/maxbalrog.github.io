Abstract:

Nonlinear Compton scattering is a promising source of bright gamma-rays. Using readily available intense laser pulses to scatter off the energetic electrons on the one hand allows to significantly increase the total photon yield, but on the other hand leads to a dramatic spectral broadening of fundamental emission line as well as its harmonics due to the laser pulse shape induced ponderomotive effects. In this paper we propose to avoid ponderomotive broadening in harmonics by using the polarization gating technique - a well-known method to construct a laser pulse with temporally varying polarization. We show that by restricting harmonic emission only to the region near the peak of the pulse, where the polarization is linear, it is possible to generate a bright narrow bandwidth comb in the gamma region.

Abstract:

We discuss the effect of radiation friction and quantum recoil on the parameters of a gamma comb with narrow spectral peaks, arising when use is made of laser pulses with time-dependent polarisation, which reduces significantly the ponderomotive broadening of harmonics. A detailed numerical study of the contribution of the electron beam nonideality to the observability of the effect is presented.
